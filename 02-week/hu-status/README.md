# Weekly Status - Week 02

<!-- CONFIG-START - must match your profile repo (username/username) CONFIG -->
- FULL_NAME: Ximena del Pilar Zambrano Chala
- GITHUB_USER: XimenaChala
- TEAM: G1
- SPRINT_GOAL: Set up the MVP 1 Scrum board, repo, branch strategy (develop/qa/main), branch protection, and labels so the 3-person team can start their HU branches
<!-- CONFIG-END -->

## 1. User stories worked this week
| HU ID | Title | Status (todo/doing/done) | Evidence (PR or commit URL) |
|---|---|---|---|
| N/A | Sprint 1 setup (repo, branches, rulesets, labels, Project board) | done | |

## 2. My individual contribution
- Created the `edutrack` repository and configured `develop`, `qa`, `main` branches
- Set up a GitHub ruleset protecting `develop`, `qa`, and `main` (PR required, 1 approval)
- Created the 14 custom labels (hu-001–hu-005, module:*, type:*)
- Built the GitHub Project board (Backlog, To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done) with Módulo and Historia fields
- No individual HU assigned yet — team has not yet split ownership of HU-001 to HU-005 across the 3 members

## 3. Blockers and risks
- Team has not yet confirmed who owns each HU / module among the 3 members

## 4. Plan for next week
- Confirm HU/module assignment per team member
- Open the first `feat/HU-XXX` branches and start implementation

## 5. Compliance self-check
- [x] Conventional Commits - `type(scope): summary`
- [x] Per-environment HU branch + PR to that environment (feat/HU-XX -> develop, HU-XX-qa -> qa, release/x.x.x -> main)
- [ ] Testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Tests added/updated (unit / integration)
- [ ] DDD / hexagonal boundaries respected (domain has no I/O)
- [x] No secrets; config via environment variables
